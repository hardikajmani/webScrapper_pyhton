# webScrapper_python

Had this site where you can get the number of registrations done by each code.

Was a very tedious task to manually enter each code and then get the results.

So this script automates the process for a group of codes (each group has 5 codes),
by entering, submitting and scrapping the results of each code.

package used - roboBrowser
